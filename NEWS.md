# c14bazAAR 1.3.0

## general changes
- added a CITATION file (see citation("c14bazAAR"))
- deprecated `mark_duplicates` to get rid of this extra step. You can get the same result now with `remove_duplicates(mark_only = TRUE)` (#100)
- deprecated `coordinate_precision`. The functionality was not essential and the calculated precision values probably frequently misleading. Beyond that the name was confusing (#96) (#106)
- deprecated `finalize_country_name`. This wrapper function was rather confusing and the functionality can be very easily be reimplemented if necessary (#96) (#106)
- renamed `standardize_country_name` to `fix_database_country_name` to make more clear what it does (#96) (#106)
- switched from openxlsx to readxl & writexl for handling xlsx files (#105) (#111)

## new getter functions
- added getter function for MesoRAD database: `get_mesorad` (#112)
- added getter function for Katsianis et al. database: `get_katsianis` (#103)
- added getter function for PACEA database: `get_pacea` (#90)
- added getter function for 14C-Palaeolithic database: `get_14cpalaeolithic` (#90)
- added getter function for MedAfriCarbon database: `get_medafricarbon` (#95)
- added getter function for J≈çmon population dynamics database: `get_jomon` (#95)
- added getter function for emedyd database: `get_emedyd` (#102)
- added getter function for OxA/ORAU database (via IntChron): `get_oxa` (#115)

# c14bazAAR 1.0.3

## general changes
- reformatted authors in DESCRIPTION and added ORCIDs (#72)
- added a [citation](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR#citation) section to the README
- added a [checklist](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR#adding-database-getter-functions) to the README on how to add new getter functions
- work on an article for the Journal of Open Source Software (paper.md + paper.bib)

## new features
- added new options for the deduplication function (see `?duplicates`) (#63)
- added an internal function `clean_labnr` to the `as.c14_date_list` workflow to fix certain syntactically wrong representations of lab numbers in several input databases as part of the downloading process (#61)
- better implementation of the `c14_date_list` as a subclass of tibble for a better integration of the subclass into the tidyverse (#67)

## bugfixes
- small file path construction fix in context getter function
- replaced some deprecated functions by other packages (dplyr::funs & tibble::as.tibble)
- replaced `RCurl::url.exists` with `httr::http_error` in `check_connection_to_url` (#68)
- fixed `as.sf` error that occurred when date lists with dates without coordinates were transformed

## removed objects
- data objects `c14bazAAR::country_thesaurus`, `c14bazAAR::material_thesaurus`, `c14bazAAR::variable-reference` have been removed from the package -- they are queried from [here](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR/tree/master/data-raw) anyway and it's not necessary to put them into the package
- some helper functions have been made internal
- .Rd files for unexported, internal objects have been removed (@noRd)
