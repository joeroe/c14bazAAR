c14bazAAR is an R package to query different openly accessible radiocarbon date databases. It allows basic data cleaning, calibration and merging. If you're not familiar with R other tools (such as [GoGet](https://www.ibercrono.org/goget/index.php)) to search for radiocarbon dates might be better suited for your needs.

If you want to use data downloaded with c14bazAAR for your research, you have to cite the source databases. Most databases have a preferred way of citation that also may change over time with new versions and publications. Please check the [respective homepages](#databases) to find out more. The output of c14bazAAR does not contain the full citations of the individual dates, but only a short reference tag. For further information you have to consult the source databases.

### Installation

We recommend to install the development version from github with the following command (in your R console):

```
if(!require('remotes')) install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github("ropensci/c14bazAAR")
```

It is up-to-date and includes more databases and features compared to the CRAN version, though it might be a little bit more unstable. Installing the development version on Windows requires the toolchain bundle [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

An older, stable version of c14bazAAR is on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) and you can install it with:

```
install.packages("c14bazAAR")
```

The package needs a lot of other packages -- many of them only necessary for specific tasks. Functions that require certain packages you don't have installed yet will stop and ask you to enable them. Please do so with [`install.packages()`](https://www.r-bloggers.com/installing-r-packages/) to download and install the respective packages from CRAN.

### How to use

The package contains a set of getter functions (see below) to query the databases. Thereby not every available variable from every archive is downloaded. Instead c14bazAAR focuses on a [selection](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR/blob/master/data-raw/variable_reference.csv) of the most important and most common variables to achieve a certain degree of standardization. The downloaded dates are stored in the custom S3 class `c14_date_list` which acts as a wrapper around the [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) class and provides specific class methods.

A workflow to download and prepare all dates could look like this:

```
library(c14bazAAR)
library(magrittr)

get_c14data("all") %>%
  remove_duplicates() %>%
  calibrate() %>%
  classify_material() %>%
  determine_country_by_coordinate()
```

It takes quite some time to run all of this and it's probably not necessary for your use case. Here's a list of the main tasks c14bazAAR can handle. That allows you to pick what you need:

#### Download

c14bazAAR contains a growing selection of getter functions to download radiocarbon date databases. [Here's](#databases) a list of all available databases. You can download all dates at once with [`get_c14data("all")`](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR/blob/master/R/get_c14data.R). The getters download the data, adjust the variable selection according to a defined [variable key](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR/blob/master/data-raw/variable_reference.csv) and transform the resulting list into a `c14_date_list`. 

See `?get_c14data` for more information.

```
x <- get_c14data("all")
```

#### Calibration

The [`calibrate()`](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR/blob/master/R/c14_date_list_calibrate.R) function calibrates all valid dates in a `c14_date_list` individually with [`Bchron::BchronCalibrate()`](https://github.com/andrewcparnell/Bchron/blob/master/R/BchronCalibrate.R). It provides two different types of output: calprobdistr and calrange.

See `?calibrate` for more information.

```
x %>% calibrate()
```

#### Material classification

Most 14C databases provide some information about the material sampled for the individual date. Unfortunately this information is often very specific and makes filtering operations difficult for large datasets. The function [`classify_material()`](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR/blob/master/R/c14_date_list_classify_material.R) relies on a [custom made classification](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR/blob/master/data-raw/material_thesaurus.csv) to simplify this data.

See `?classify_material` for more information and look [here](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR/blob/master/data-raw/material_thesaurus_comments.md) for a change log of the thesaurus.

```
x %>% classify_material()
```

#### Country attribution

Filtering 14C dates by country is useful for a first spatial limitation and especially important, if no coordinates are documented. Most databases provide the variable country, but they don't rely on a unified naming convention and therefore use various terms to represent the same entity. The function [`fix_database_country_name()`](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR/blob/master/R/c14_date_list_spatial_fix_database_country_name.R) tries to unify the semantically equal terms by string comparison with the curated country name list [`countrycode::codelist`](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/countrycode) and a [custom made thesaurus](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR/blob/master/data-raw/country_thesaurus.csv). Beyond that it turned out to be much more reliable to look at the coordinates to determine the country.

That's what the function [`determine_country_by_coordinate()`](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR/blob/master/R/c14_date_list_spatial_determine_country_by_coordinate.R) does. It joins the position with country polygons from [`rworldxtra::countriesHigh`](https://github.com/AndySouth/rworldxtra) to get reliable country attribution.

See `?country_attribution` for more information.

```
x %>%
  fix_database_country_name() %>%
  determine_country_by_coordinate()
```

#### Duplicates

Some of the source databases already contain duplicated dates and for sure you'll have some if you combine different databases. As a result of the long history of these archives, which includes even mutual absorption, duplicates make up a significant proportion of combined datasets. It's not trivial to find and deal with theses duplicates, because they are not exactly identical between databases: Sometimes they are linked to conflicting and mutually exclusive context information.

For an automatic search and removal based on identical lab numbers we wrote [`remove_duplicates()`](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR/blob/master/R/c14_date_list_duplicates_remove.R). This functions offers several options on how exactly duplicates should be treated.

If you call `remove_duplicates()` with the option `mark_only = TRUE` then no data is removed, but you can inspect the duplicate groups identified.

See `?duplicates` for more information.

```
x %>%
  remove_duplicates()
```

#### Conversion

A c14_date_list can be directly converted to other R data structures. So far only [`as.sf()`](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR/blob/master/R/c14_date_list_convert.R) is implemented. The sf package provides great tools to manipulate and plot spatial vector data. This simplifies certain spatial operations with the date point cloud.

See `?as.sf` for more information.

```
x %>% as.sf()
```

#### Technical functions

c14_date_lists are constructed with [`as.c14_date_list`](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR/blob/master/R/c14_date_list_basic.R). This function takes data.frames or tibbles and adds the c14_date_list class tag. It also calls [`order_variables()`](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR/blob/master/R/c14_date_list_order_variables.R) to establish a certain variable order and [`enforce_types()`](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR/blob/master/R/c14_date_list_enforce_types.R) which converts all variables to the correct data type. There are custom `print()`, `format()` and `plot()` methods for c14_date_lists.

The [`fuse()`](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR/blob/master/R/c14_date_list_fuse.R) function allows to rowbind multiple c14_date_lists.

See `?as.c14_date_list` and `?fuse`.

```
x1 <- data.frame(
  c14age = 2000,
  c14std = 30
) %>% as.c14_date_list()

x2 <- fuse(x1, x1)
```

#### Plotting radiocarbon data

c14bazAAR only provides a very basic `plot` function for `c14_date_list`s. The [simple plotting vignette](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR/blob/master/vignettes/simple_plotting.Rmd) introduces some techniques to help you get started with more sophisticated visualization.

#### Other radiocarbon packages

There are several R packages that provide functions to calibrate, analyze or model radiocarbon dates: e.g. [oxcAAR](https://github.com/ISAAKiel/oxcAAR), [rcarbon](https://github.com/ahb108/rcarbon), [Bchron](https://github.com/andrewcparnell/Bchron)

They usually have a simple, vector based interface and you can use `c14_date_list` columns as input.

```
rcarbon::calibrate(x = x$c14age, error = x$c14std)
```

#### Adding database getter functions

If you want to add another radiocarbon database to c14bazAAR (maybe from the list [here](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR/issues/2)) you can follow this checklist to apply all the necessary changes to the package:

1. Add your database to the [variable_reference table](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR/blob/master/data-raw/variable_reference.csv) and map the database variables to the variables of c14bazAAR and other databases. Please also add additional variables, which are not used in c14bazAAR but available in this database, below.
2. Write the getter function `get_[The Database Name]` in an own script file: **get_[the database name].R**. For the script file names we used a lowercase version of the database name. The function name on the other hand can contain upper case letters. The getter functions have a standardized layout and always yield an object of the class `c14_date_list`. Please look at some of the available functions to get an idea how it is supposed to look like and which checks it has to include. Make sure not to store data outside of `tempdir()`. Some databases include non-radiocarbon dates: Make sure to filter them out -- c14bazAAR so far only works with radiocarbon dates.
3. Add the following roxygen2 tags above the function definition to include it in the package documentation.

```
#' @rdname db_getter_backend
#' @export
```

4. Update the package documentation with roxygen2.
5. Add the database url(s) to the [url_reference table](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR/blob/master/data-raw/url_reference.csv) to make sure that `get_db_url("[the database name]")` works. `get_db_url()` relies on the file version on the master branch, so maybe you have to find a temporary solution for this as long as you are working in another branch.
6. Update the [material_thesaurus table](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR/blob/master/data-raw/material_thesaurus.csv) with all the new material names in the database you want to add and document the changes [here](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR/blob/master/data-raw/material_thesaurus_comments.md). You can test this with `classify_material()`.
7. Do the same for the [country thesaurus table](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR/blob/master/data-raw/country_thesaurus.csv) if necessary (`fix_database_country_name()`).
8. Add the function to the functions vector in [`get_all_parser_functions()`](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR/blob/master/R/get_c14data.R#L128).
9. Document the addition of the new function in the NEWS.md file.
10. Add the new database to the list of *Currently available databases* in the DESCRIPTION file.
11. Add your function to the database list in the README file [here](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR#databases).
